    <h1>UMD enrolled students test score behavior changes admist strict admissions </h1>
    <h3>By Nicole Pilsbury</h3>
    <p>The University of Maryland is increasing in prestige after being named a "Public Ivy" by Forbes magazine, therefore increasing the university's application numbers. Despite the increased number of applications, UMD's enrollment number stays consistent around 6,000 per year- meaning a smaller percent of students who apply are admitted.
