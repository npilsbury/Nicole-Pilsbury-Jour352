                        FLAT ROCK, N.C. — Michael Cheek gunned his white truck up the rocky hill as helicopters whirred
                        overhead. His tires crunched over the unpaved roads, dulling the near-constant crackling of his
                        walkie-talkie:

                    <p class="text">
                        The spring wildfire season had barely begun, but already it was relentless. Cheek, the North
                        Carolina Forest Service’s mountain division director, needed to get to the top of the ridge,
                        where yet another new blaze was approaching.

                        “Due to the Helene debris, the fires are going to be bigger,” Cheek said. “Homes are going to
                        burn. And hopefully no one dies.”

            While conflagrations in the West — like the devastating fires that tore through Los Angeles in January —
            tend to capture Americans’ attention, the region spanning from Texas to Virginia regularly sees more
            wildfires than any other part of the country.

                        The Southeast accounted for more than one-third of U.S. wildfires last year, according to the
                        National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), and nearly half in 2023.

                    <p class="text">
                        Already this year, fires have prompted evacuations in states including South Carolina, Oklahoma,
                        Texas and North Carolina, where numerous blazes continue to rage, including the Black Cove Fire
                        south of Asheville, which on Tuesday was still burning uncontained and had grown to more than
                        3,000 acres.

                    <p class="text">
                        One 2023 study found that while the West continues to dominate research and federal spending on
                        wildfires, “recent signals suggest that wildfire risk is increasing in the eastern U.S. as
                        well.”

                    There are multiple reasons that risk is increasing, said Victoria Donovan, a professor of forest
                    management at the University of Florida, who is one of the report’s authors. But a key one is this:
                    The Southeast has a high percentage of people living in fire-prone areas.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    The Southeast’s booming population has placed more people and homes than ever in the path of
                    potential wildfires — a fact that makes fighting such blazes more and more complex, said Gary Wood,
                    a retired North Carolina Forest Service employee who now helps implement national wildland fire
                    strategies in the region.
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    “Now, it’s a whole different ballgame,” Wood said. “Everybody’s moving to the South.”

                <p class="text">
                    For example, one recent study from the U.S. Agriculture Department detailed how from 1990 to 2020,
                    North Carolina experienced rapid population growth and expansion into areas at risk for wildfire.
                    Buncombe County, home to Asheville, saw a 70 percent growth of housing in such areas, the study
                    found.

                <p class="text">
                    Foresters here have long worked to prevent out-of-control blazes on a routine basis, by
                    intentionally burning areas to get rid of potential fuel. But this year, dry and windy conditions
                    and debris from Hurricane Helene and other storms have contributed an above-normal wildfire risk.
                    And as parts of the Southeast experience rapid population growth, the blazes are becoming harder to
                    fight and contain.

                    Robert Scheller, a professor of landscape ecology at North Carolina State University, said that when
                    it comes to judging a fires’ impact, “it’s more than just the acreage burned, but also, what is the
                    density of humans on the acreage burned.”
                </p>
                <p class="text">
                    Compared with many parts of the country, he added, the South is just “a more densely settled
                    landscape.”
