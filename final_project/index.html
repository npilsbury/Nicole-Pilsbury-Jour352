                        FLAT ROCK, N.C. — Michael Cheek gunned his white truck up the rocky hill as helicopters whirred
                        overhead. His tires crunched over the unpaved roads, dulling the near-constant crackling of his
                        walkie-talkie:

                        The spring wildfire season had barely begun, but already it was relentless. Cheek, the North
                        Carolina Forest Service’s mountain division director, needed to get to the top of the ridge,
                        where yet another new blaze was approaching.

            While conflagrations in the West — like the devastating fires that tore through Los Angeles in January —
            tend to capture Americans’ attention, the region spanning from Texas to Virginia regularly sees more
            wildfires than any other part of the country.

                        The Southeast accounted for more than one-third of U.S. wildfires last year, according to the
                        National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), and nearly half in 2023.

                        Already this year, fires have prompted evacuations in states including South Carolina, Oklahoma,
                        Texas and North Carolina, where numerous blazes continue to rage, including the Black Cove Fire
                        south of Asheville, which on Tuesday was still burning uncontained and had grown to more than
                        3,000 acres.

                        One 2023 study found that while the West continues to dominate research and federal spending on
                        wildfires, “recent signals suggest that wildfire risk is increasing in the eastern U.S. as
                        well.”

                        There are multiple reasons that risk is increasing, said Victoria Donovan, a professor of forest
                        management at the University of Florida, who is one of the report’s authors. But a key one is
                        this: The Southeast has a high percentage of people living in fire-prone areas.

                    <p class="text">
                        The Southeast’s booming population has placed more people and homes than ever in the path of
                        potential wildfires — a fact that makes fighting such blazes more and more complex, said Gary
                        Wood, a retired North Carolina Forest Service employee who now helps implement national wildland
                        fire strategies in the region.

                        For example, one recent study from the U.S. Agriculture Department detailed how from 1990 to
                        2020, North Carolina experienced rapid population growth and expansion into areas at risk for
                        wildfire. Buncombe County, home to Asheville, saw a 70 percent growth of housing in such areas,
                        the study found.

                        Foresters here have long worked to prevent out-of-control blazes on a routine basis, by
                        intentionally burning areas to get rid of potential fuel. But this year, dry and windy
                        conditions and debris from Hurricane Helene and other storms have contributed an above-normal
                        wildfire risk. And as parts of the Southeast experience rapid population growth, the blazes are
                        becoming harder to fight and contain.

                        Robert Scheller, a professor of landscape ecology at North Carolina State University, said that
                        when it comes to judging a fires’ impact, “it’s more than just the acreage burned, but also,
                        what is the density of humans on the acreage burned.”

                    <p class="text">
                        Compared with many parts of the country, he added, the South is just “a more densely settled

                        smoke in the distance. Huge trees felled by Hurricane Helene, the remnants of which blew through
                        here in late September, blocked pathways in the forest.

                        the hill ablaze, in hopes that the already-charred ground would slow the wildfire’s hungry path
                        toward any homes in the area.

                        Asheville, has seen firsthand the risks posed by conditions in the Southeast. Earlier this
                        month, firefighters spent days combating a blaze that grew rapidly to 600 acres along U.S. Route
                        176, not far from the town of Saluda.

                        Arledge, who said he has worked in the county since 1994, is used to the low humidity and high
                        winds that this season often brings. But in the wake of Helene, he said, “I’ve never seen this
                        much debris down.”

                        And it is likely to linger for years, he added, in part because so much of it is on private
                        property. That means the heightened risk for fiercer and more frequent wildfires in the area
                        will loom for a long time to come.
