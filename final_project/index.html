                        FLAT ROCK, N.C. — Michael Cheek gunned his white truck up the rocky hill as helicopters whirred
                        overhead. His tires crunched over the unpaved roads, dulling the near-constant crackling of his
                        walkie-talkie:

                    <p class="text">
                        The spring wildfire season had barely begun, but already it was relentless. Cheek, the North
                        Carolina Forest Service’s mountain division director, needed to get to the top of the ridge,
                        where yet another new blaze was approaching.

                        “Due to the Helene debris, the fires are going to be bigger,” Cheek said. “Homes are going to

                        While conflagrations in the West — like the devastating fires that tore through Los Angeles in
                        January — tend to capture Americans’ attention, the region spanning from Texas to Virginia
                        regularly sees more wildfires than any other part of the country.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The Southeast accounted for more than one-third of U.S. wildfires last year, according to the
                        National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), and nearly half in 2023.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Already this year, fires have prompted evacuations in states including South Carolina, Oklahoma,
                        Texas and North Carolina, where numerous blazes continue to rage, including the Black Cove Fire
                        south of Asheville, which on Tuesday was still burning uncontained and had grown to more than
                        3,000 acres.

                    <p class="text">
                        One 2023 study found that while the West continues to dominate research and federal spending on
                        wildfires, “recent signals suggest that wildfire risk is increasing in the eastern U.S. as
                        well.”

                        There are multiple reasons that risk is increasing, said Victoria Donovan, a professor of forest
                        management at the University of Florida, who is one of the report’s authors. But a key one is
                        this: The Southeast has a high percentage of people living in fire-prone areas.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        The Southeast’s booming population has placed more people and homes than ever in the path of
                        potential wildfires — a fact that makes fighting such blazes more and more complex, said Gary
                        Wood, a retired North Carolina Forest Service employee who now helps implement national wildland
                        fire strategies in the region.

                    <p class="text">
                        “Now, it’s a whole different ballgame,” Wood said. “Everybody’s moving to the South.”

                    <p class="text">
                        For example, one recent study from the U.S. Agriculture Department detailed how from 1990 to
                        2020, North Carolina experienced rapid population growth and expansion into areas at risk for
                        wildfire. Buncombe County, home to Asheville, saw a 70 percent growth of housing in such areas,
                        the study found.

                        Foresters here have long worked to prevent out-of-control blazes on a routine basis, by
                        intentionally burning areas to get rid of potential fuel. But this year, dry and windy
                        conditions and debris from Hurricane Helene and other storms have contributed an above-normal
                        wildfire risk. And as parts of the Southeast experience rapid population growth, the blazes are
                        becoming harder to fight and contain.

                        Robert Scheller, a professor of landscape ecology at North Carolina State University, said that
                        when it comes to judging a fires’ impact, “it’s more than just the acreage burned, but also,
                        what is the density of humans on the acreage burned.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        Compared with many parts of the country, he added, the South is just “a more densely settled
                        landscape.”

                        smoke in the distance. Huge trees felled by Hurricane Helene, the remnants of which blew through
                        here in late September, blocked pathways in the forest.

                        the hill ablaze, in hopes that the already-charred ground would slow the wildfire’s hungry path
                        toward any homes in the area.

                        Asheville, has seen firsthand the risks posed by conditions in the Southeast. Earlier this
                        month, firefighters spent days combating a blaze that grew rapidly to 600 acres along U.S. Route
                        176, not far from the town of Saluda.

                        Arledge, who said he has worked in the county since 1994, is used to the low humidity and high
                        winds that this season often brings. But in the wake of Helene, he said, “I’ve never seen this
                        much debris down.”

                        And it is likely to linger for years, he added, in part because so much of it is on private
                        property. That means the heightened risk for fiercer and more frequent wildfires in the area
                        will loom for a long time to come.

                        experienced fires until January, when one tore through their backyard, devouring their beloved
                        blueberry and azalea bushes and charring the massive oaks that Helene’s strong winds felled in
                        September.

                        downed trees as her 7-year-old goldendoodle Ruby trotted by her side. “Gardening was kind of my
                        thing. That’s been the hardest part.”

                        collected some 50 guitars that hang all through their house. He has a tremor that makes it hard
                        to carry a cup of coffee to the couch without spilling — but when he plays, he’s steady.

                    <p class="text">
                        But in these residential areas, fires could become more and more of a reality. An October
                        assessment by the North Carolina Forest Service estimated that 822,000 acres of timberland
                        suffered some sort of damage during the storm, with more than three-quarters of that on private
                        land. In neighboring Tennessee, Helene’s wrath was not as extensive, but even so the state’s

                        The timber could provide more than a decade of ground fuel for fires as it continues to dry out,
                        say foresters. Helene toppled oak trees before they had shed their leaves for winter, said Adam
                        Warwick, a fire manager at the North Carolina chapter of the Nature Conservancy, a nonprofit
                        organization working on restoration across the region. Now those dead leaves on the ground, when
                        ignited, create large blazes that can make the fires more intense. The oak itself could take a
                        long time to completely dry out, providing fuel for many years to come.

                        Ludie Bond, a public information officer for the Florida Forest Service, said that two other
                        hurricanes last year, Debby and Milton, also blew down a lot of heavy timber in the South.
                        Earlier this month, a wildfire broke out in Miami-Dade County, burning more than 26,000 acres.

                        The Hardys have thought about leaving Old Fort after so many months of extreme weather. “We’ve
                        shopped around,” said Tim. “But we can’t find any place that would be better.”

                    <h3>Fighting fire with fire</h3>
                    <p class="text">
                        One way conservationists and foresters are trying to reduce these risks is through prescribed
                        burning, a practice of lighting a forest fire under safe conditions to prevent more
                        out-of-control burns in the future.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        For decades, forest managers have suppressed fires, leaving more fuel on the ground.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">
                        “The South is the exception,” Warwick said. “The culture of prescribed burning has continued.”
                    </p>
                    <p class="text">But the same factors driving wildfires make it harder to sustain this approach.</p>

                        On a cloudless Tuesday morning, members of the North Carolina Forest Service and the Nature
                        Conservancy gathered in an empty field in DuPont State Forest, which boasts more than 10,000
                        acres, many waterfalls, and attracts some 1.2 million visitors each year.

                        Warwick’s team at the Nature Conservancy helps state foresters, struggling with staff shortages,
                        carry out burns about 50 times a year. They travel across state lines, into Tennessee and South
                        Carolina. It’s grueling work that pays between $18 and $25 an hour — most workers hold other
                        jobs.

                        Jenifer Mallinoff, a Maryland native who moved to the area four years ago, led her second burn
                        ever for the group in DuPont. Her voice was calm and precise as she instructed her team to dip
                        red cans full of fuel onto the dried underbrush and start the flames. Soon the crackling of
                        kindling echoed through the forest. Huge plumes of smoke rose into the air.

                        For most of the workers, fire and nature go hand in hand. Warwick delighted in the burning
                        surroundings, pointing out salamander habitats, woodpeckers and rare plants. These activities
                        clear space for new plants that thrive in direct sunlight to emerge, he said. But he added that
                        their work is growing more difficult as more people move closer to the forests, since they can
                        complain.
